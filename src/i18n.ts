            "a": "In 2026, a comprehensive 4-room BTO renovation in Singapore typically ranges from <strong>$45,000 to $65,000</strong>. This estimate covers essential works like flooring, painting, plumbing, and custom carpentry for the kitchen and wardrobes. Premium \"Warm Luxury\" finishes or extensive hacking for \"broken-plan\" layouts can push costs to $75,000+."

            "q": "How can I maximize storage in a small HDB layout?",

Implement <strong>smart-integrated solutions</strong> like platform beds with drawers, hidden storage within feature walls, and extendable dining tables. \"Lived-in Japandi\" designs often use concealed cabinetry to maintain a clutter-free, minimalist aesthetic without sacrificing functionality."

            "q": "Why is choosing an HDB-registered contractor important for safety?",
            "a": "Choosing an HDB-registered contractor is crucial because they are trained to strictly adhere to <strong>HDB's renovation guidelines</strong> and structural safety protocols. They ensure that no critical structural pillars are compromised during hacking and that all electrical and plumbing works meet Singapore's safety standards, protecting you from liability and safety hazards."
